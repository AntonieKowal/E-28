# Project 2
+ By: Antonie Kowal
+ Production URL: <http://e28p2.antonievue.xyz>

## Pages summary
+ Home Page
+ Posts page (shows all)
+ Post page (shows one)
+ Create a new Post page

## SFC summary
My single file components were very similar to the ones created in the ZipFoods examples. I have the 4 page components
as described in the section above, then in addition a single stand-alone SFC used in both the Posts page and Post page.
  
## Server interaction
Currently my application only Reads and Creates blog posts. You can see how each interaction works with its
corresponding page.

## Notes for instructor
I don't feel great about taking "MVP" to the bare-minimum level that I did with this project, but I hope to be able to 
expand on the number of features a little more when building upon this project for P3! I'd like to at the very least
add error handling and the remaining CRUD operations that I am currently missing.
