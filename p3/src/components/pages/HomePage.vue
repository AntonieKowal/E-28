        <p>Welcome to my crappy landing page!</p>
        <p>With this Vue application, you can create a blog post and read posts that others have created. I didn't get around to making 
            things look pretty yet, but P3 will have some more CSS! Hopefully you are able to at least navigate around the simple site and create a new post. 
            Also, in the future, this home page will need a more defined purpose rather than me just randomly typing in text to fill out some white space.

        </p>
